# Eye_Detection_using_Integral_Image

We implemented an algorithm that performs eye detection by using the integral image. This is to be done by detecting eye areas in faces through convolving a kernel that is designed to detect that area. The algorithm is structured as follows:

1. Calculate the integral image and calculate the local sum
2. Detect the eye area
